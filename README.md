# Interactive Chess Game

Prior to running project:

1. Install all requirements using ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` or individually by installing arcade and stockfish via pip.

To run the project, simply run main.py. The program will take a minute to open upon first being run as it installs the Stockfish engine. Upon starting, click a piece to show all legal moves as green tiles. Drag the piece to one of these tiles to move it. 

The game will continue as long as the player and opponent have legal moves to make. Once they no longer do, no new green tiles will appear.
